# The SSH Saga 

I haven't made any successful connection with the virtualbox through Windows, I'm suspecting I should watch rob's way, but I got so hooked in trying to figure it out
I'm willing to test a few things before, it taught me about ufw( firewall native to ubuntu), how SFTP works and why the shell is safer than telnet, which could be sniffed
easily. I tried installing outty as I mentioned before, but I didn't work it out quite as I was expecting, it still give me connection refused. There's some steps I could take
on from here:

1. Give up and watch the rest of the lesson
2. Try to ssh ubuntu into ubuntu( I successfuly got access when i type the user@177.777.77)
3. ssh windows terminal from ubuntu ?

      #saga #ssh #ubuntu #virtualbox
