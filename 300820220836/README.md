# SSH-ing everything

I successfuly made a few tests using ssh in several devices, first I tried using gitbash to connect remotely, later on Windows Terminal so I could perfom rob's homework, after that
I tried cmd(DOS) and it worked perfectly. I'm a little bit curious so I tried putty and termius at the same time and also I tried juiceSSH on my phone( some security concerns about OSS).
Everything went according to plan, so I'll assume we managed to finish the ssh topic, at least for getting a connection.

      #ssh #juiceSSH #DOS #gitbash #windowsterminal #putty #termius
