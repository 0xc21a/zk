# I'm trying to SSH into Ubuntu

So far it has been really difficult for me to find a way to connect myself into my ubuntu machine from my windows terminal, I tried the OpenSSH method, with the built-in
tool I had no idea windows supported(since 2018 apparently), I basically refused to use PuTTy, I wanna learn how to do it from my own terminal. I tried disabling the firewall
ssh encounters in ubuntu(sudo ufw allow ssh), but nothing happened, it stills refuses me( port 22 refused or vice versa). I tried installing git bash using gui, but
it didn't make much difference, so far I couldn't do it, but I'll try again.

     #openssh #ssh #ubuntu #windowsterminal
