# using vim as a text editor

I still need to fully grasp the tech, I used nano in the past to edit a few files in **Kali Linux**. Rob will teach us in the course how to use the full
potential of vim, he says it will be more powerful than using vscode which he used in the past. He also mentioned he totally hates neovim and other related 
techs. In my opinion I think it will be wonderful for my knowledge as a beginner coder to be able to master vim and the Linux command line, I need to put more
effort into understanding the bash script.

    #bash #script #vim #neovim #Kalilinux
