# Think like a hacker

I'm amazed with how much I've learned  and developed while studying under the mentorship of Rob, but I must focus in developing my own skills as well, just like he said, he's 
teaching us how to ride a bike, but it's up to us how to keep going. We must understand the problems, apply the logic and solve it. Always evolve to be part moving culture.
I'll make my time more organized, I'll be focused entirely on this course, I'll learn and apply, trial and error will be the modus operandis for this type of learning.
