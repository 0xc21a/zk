# My journey to learn Find

I've learning a few tricks with find, it is really powerful and I might do wonders with it, especially in finding specific files with or without symbolic linking, like
find -perm 446, which lists all the files with write and execute permissions, but not read for others. I maybe wrong, but if you read this, you'll know which one is correct.
