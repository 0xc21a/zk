# I fixed the problem with headless start

At first I had no idea why my command VboxManage or startvm were not working properly(" not recognized "), so I did some digging and found out it could be fixed simply by
creating a $PATH to the Virtualbox folder, I did it through the DOS, but it can be done using the GUI. I'm relieved it worked, I was planning to use the GUI version throughout
the Boost, but since it worked, I'm quite happy with it.

        #headless #start #DOS #Virtualboxfolder
