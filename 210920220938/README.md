# DHCP problem and vmware

I managed to fix it, but it's temporary(maybe?), I do wish to keep it using though, VMWARE is undoubtly the best virtualization software out there and it has
many possibilities. Rob's ova also helped me a lot, I did want to install my own ubuntu server again, but the ova has many tools useful for me, so I can learn better 
and faster. It's day 21st, so I'll be doing week 6 this entire week, exercises, reviewing and all of it.
