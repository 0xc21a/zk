# Finished the installation Ubuntu Server

Installing ubuntu server was quite practical, I really liked it and I will probably do it in a different manner, maybe another distro ? the important
steps we took were allocating the right gb for memory, we did 2080, it was recommended 8GB of ram for new users. we also allocated another 20gb for our system.
virtualbox asked us to divide or partionate our hard drive, since it's a completely off the grid hard drive(hence virtual) we were able to do it pretty nicely.

   #virtualbox #ubuntu #memory
