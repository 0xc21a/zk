I had a few problems with virtualbox and I Had to remove it from my computer because it interferes with my vmware machine, making it unusuable without a dhcp connection.
I really liked rob's ova machine, it has tmux, lynx and all of the cool stuff present in his setup. I might as well learn it myself so I can use it later on another machines
 I'll be installing.
