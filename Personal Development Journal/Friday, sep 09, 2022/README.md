I've been quite lazy in the past few days, I took almost a week to finish a four hour boost from rwxrob. I mean, it's not something healthy to do, I need to get my shit
done. I must work hard and apply myself to it. I spent the day messing with lynx and tmux, at morning I tried finishing the last 40 minutes of rwxrob's boost, but I must
have ADHD or something. I learned about copying files, moving them, permissions, how to use chmod and chown, besides learning how to navigate through files decently. I'm
quite interested in rewatching this last boost, I'm feeling like I didn't pay much attention like I used to, I must do it, I need to, so I'll be doing this task probably tomorrow
or sunday.

That's something, huh ? she died yesterday and the entire world is grieving. I'm not too fond of the royal family itself, I don't like monarchies, but I'm not british, so 
my opinion is worthless in regards to the crown. She died sep 8, 2022 at probably 4pm to 5pm?, I don't know, but I'm like most of the gen z folks who grew up with this idea of the queen,the
old lady living in britain, a pig, maybe someone who stole from the poor?, But I don't hate her, I actually liked her, especially for her initiatives in regards to the
apartheid in SA and other humanitarians contributions, but as I said, fuck the king and also the nobility. May she rest in peace, farewell betty.

Yes, i'm a tech savvy and I didn't want to be left behind when I found out about tmux and lynx, I needed them in my life, to be able to search in just two seconds and also
have a dozen panels, switching between different tasks in hand, I maybe too emotional, but I definitely need this tool in my life.
