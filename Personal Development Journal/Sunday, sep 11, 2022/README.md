In a 40 minutes or less a plane will hit the World Trade Center, not long after a second plane will hit the North tower and trap thousands of people in the upper floors,
firemen, policemen, workers, men and women who lost their lives due to a barbaric terrorist attack perpetrated by savages. It's the 21st anniversary of the tragedy, the
thorn in america's side, the memories still live on, the fear never went away, but love came to our rescue and united the country. I wasn't even born when 9/11 happened, I would
be delivered four months later, but I grew up interested in history, so probably in some point of my life I found out about those terrible attacks. I do get sad,
angry when I think about those families who lost their loved ones, their fathers, mothers, uncles, aunties, grandparents and so on, but the love they found in each other
is what matters now, not what happened, that's what the terrorists wanted,isn't ? to bring fear and death to the country, but it didn't happen, America became united and fought
for its survival and freedom. I'm not going get political about patriot act and some diversions in iraq, which I'm against, but the center core is, they did something and the world
watched America fight back. Rest in peace all of those souls lost in the 9/11 attacks
