I'll be reviewing today the boost week 4 so I can totally understand each nuance of each subject taught. I'm starting right now with opening my virtualbox and remotely
connecting to my Windows Terminal, we need to understand networking soon, so we can understand DHCP, HTTPS and other OSI models. We'll working with SSH right away, which is important to understand. We'll understand about file permissions today.

We're talking about unix being a multiuser system, the shared process which was the mandatory thing back in the day. Unix timeshare had multiple users whom would
use the system, create users,so that's why we have a home directory for each user. I'll be studying about unix timeshare and how it helped develop the computer
revolution( Now we got them at home) which is the way to go.

I'll be reviewing what's an inode( files) since everything is an inode(file). Inode is important, so we can understand how files are stored, their permissions.

Learn binary, it will be important for coding, especially decimal, octal and other formats of data. It will be done in the boost practice I've set up for later.

Rob is teaching us about file permissions, we're right now talking about rwx( read, write and execute, he also taught us the command for seeing those permissions, which is ls -ld with or without a dot. There's also ls -la or ls -l, for minor details, ls -ld /././././ which is a trick, because you never leave home. The boost so far has addressed several questions of mine, like the computer revolution was possible due to insatisfaction by accounting, which back in the 80s had to use a 
specific hardware unix-like to be able to use a program called visicalc( similar to excel) and there was a unix timeshare, which left the accounting team with little to no time to use the software. Rob also mentioned about studying about binary, which it will be done, after I fully understand the unix timeshare, which is responsible for the home directory system. I'll be posting more details until three hours are completed, and I'll review each subject taught and post right here with the timestamp.
