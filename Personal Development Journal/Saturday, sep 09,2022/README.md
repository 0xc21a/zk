I'll be reviewing today the boost week 4 so I can totally understand each nuance of each subject taught. I'm starting right now with opening my virtualbox and remotely
connecting to my Windows Terminal, we need to understand networking soon, so we can understand DHCP, HTTPS and other OSI models. We'll working with SSH right away, which
is important to understand. We'll understand about file permissions today.
