# I must import my notes

I had notes for each lesson since week 1 in my old virtualbox machine, but since we're using the new machine with rob's ova and tmux configured, I think I must have
my notes in the machine, so I'm trying to find a good method to transfer files or maybe created my own, so I'll also learn while writing all of it again.
