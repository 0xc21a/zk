# My learning path so far

I'm happy to announce to myself I'm doing fine, my learning curving so far has been skyrocketing constantly, in this journey I've met a few folks, done lot of research
and I'm grateful for everything I learned so far, which includes zettelkasten for a complete mind map, markdown so I can edit my files with grace and practicality,
virtual machines so  I don't break my computer's hard drive, installing an iso( in this case ubuntu server), configuring a hard drive, learning about ssh connections, how
to connect to a vm machine and make it like just another house machine( using bridged adapter from NAT), SSH-ing into windows terminal and make a nice pretty terminal.
right now I'm dealing with permissions and files, especially chmod and its perks, let' see how is it going to be in the future.

       #ssh #virtualbox #ubuntu #machines
