# Learning new stuff about the command line

I'm messing with the CLI program, I might as well break it as much as I can so I can learn how to fix it. I could download other .iSOS, maybe a few from redhat and
arch. I'm not used to distro hooping, but I can get comfy with it. 

    #cli #commandline #ubuntu
