# History of the terminal

Rob was walking us through the history of the terminal, because it's different from the CLI, which is totally separated from the terminal. The thing is, the terminal
came into existence out of a necessity, because in the past, computers used punch cards, which is a binary code system if I'm not mistaken. It was highly complicated and when
the first personal computer came into existence it was even worse, you had to set a switch eight times only to type A, that's tiresome. Most folks back in the day would
connect a typewriter to the machine so it could read the data and print it out on paper, that's where the terminal came into existence, as a sort of teletype thing.
