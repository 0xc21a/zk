# Virtual Machine

Rob taught us how to install ubuntu server in our desktops, which he and so many folks in the industry find it very useful. I've heard it's because
Ubuntu Desktop is so laggy, bloated for a virtual environment. Anyway, we're configuring and then installing it. I already have a linux machine on my hard drive,
but I'll do it in rob's way just to get the knowledge, it will be useful in the sense that corporate only wants the practical use of Linux. Nobody in  the market
wanna know which distro you got, gnome vs kde or plasma, fuck that shit.

     #distro #virtualmachine #ubuntu
