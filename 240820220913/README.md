# Markdown is really great

I'm in an awe of excitement since discovering the existence of markdown(basic, pandoc and whatever other version it has), I really liked it, the core concept
it's so easy to grasp, create text, write documents and of course, making this zettelkasten. I used to write my docs using google and probably a little bit of
html5, so I think it's really revolutionary for me having this tool available. thank u aaron swartz for everything you've done for the internet.
