# Why Virtual machine instead of hard drive

It's quite common for experienced users to recommend dual booting any OS so they would fully use the hardcore software without any lagging or any other
shit related to that. I will stick with a virtual machine for a reason, first it's easier, more practical, I'll be using this in a company environment
and it will be less likely to blow up my hard drive trying to create a partition. Ubuntu in a VB will erase a virtual hard drive, which is a file, so 
I'm not gonna have any problems with booting.
