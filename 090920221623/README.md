# I must focus and be prepared

I need to focused on my tasks in hand, no need to differ or diverge in content, I must start a boost and finished it on the same day, because it's only 3 to four hours
and I need to put in work, get things done and learn from it. I mean, I'm really interested in the tech field, I wanna learn golang, bash scripting, mantain a server, maybe build
a website and get a job.
