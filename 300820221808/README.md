# JSON files and Terminal settings

I've finally came across rob's settings for his color templates applied to his .json file on vscode. It's called gruvbox and he made it himself with a few tweaks
from other developers. I also applied his color scheme to my own vscode using ssh with my git bash terminal. He also explained how json( Javascript object notation)
work with types who can be universal in every language, just differs in order and rules. Also vscode is good for beginners who just want to code with cool color schemes
without tweaking any json files or modifying it.

         #json #terminal #colorscheme
