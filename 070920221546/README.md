# 0-day vulnerability

I've been a little bit interested in the topic lately, because I find it interesting, the way hackers( white ones or maybe black ones) can understand, dissect the 
content of a exploit, create it and make it executable. The pure thought of having an exploit or vulnerability in each piece of software on the internet drives me 
insanely curious of the capabilities of a vulnerability researcher, that's why I'm investing my time with bash scripting, golang and the linux file system.
