# Vi commands

Rob talked about how nano is so difficult because of ctrl and weird settings, so he showed us how to set up vi and the commands and it's quite simple, we can use for example
ZZ to get out, ctrl left bracket to get out of insert mode. I'll be using more vi since I'm editing some files from the boost inside my machine.
