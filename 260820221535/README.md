# I'm using vi as an editor

I'm not yet ready to ssh my ubuntu server into the Windows terminal, but I'm already familiar with the text editor vi, which is really useful to edit documents and
apply my comments using markdown, which is supported. I edited some documents using vi and applied some comments, applied some text and I used it on my phone which has
a ssh ubuntu machine. I'm probably installing vim afterwards, but vi, I like it.

      #vi #vim #ubuntu #texteditor
