# I'm back

I've been away for while due to burnout, I felt sick and tired of coding, computers and that wouldn't work for someone who's trying to be a good computer scientist. I'm better
now and relaxed, I'll be resuming week 7 of rob's boost and try to review the past boost so I don't forget essential work.
