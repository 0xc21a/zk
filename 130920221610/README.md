# The Linux Command Line book

It's a fascinating book, I'll be reading it today to complete my study schedule for today, I've already watched half an hour of rob's week 5 boost, so I'll be
practising the rest, since it's better to do each boost in each respective week. I'll use the book to better understand the linux command line, the shell and
the environment.
