# Glob and global file search

Glob is just a way of searching files in a specific way using wildcards, like ```*``` or ```..``` and other format, for example we can search for files using ????? which means an
specific numbers of letters in a file or we can say ```file.???``` which will display the format like txt or doc. Glob can used altogether with find, because it is basically find 
itself, like find ``` find .name ????.txt```. This is glob 101 for me, which is the reason I'm writing this file.
