# Learn your history

It's extremely important for anyone getting into the unix/linux culture to know the inventors, the distributions, the innovators, why things happened that way and why does 
it affect us in the future.

## Why we don't use punchcards anymore ?

They're really horrible to maintain and they need constant care, so waste of time. We invented a computer to read them for us, but we had to switch on and off several
times a day, so we made it easier connecting a typewriter to the machine, so there you go, a teletype machine or tty.

## What's the holy trinity ?

Brian Kernighan, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the inventors of UNIX at Bell labs.

## Why was the C language created ?

Brian Kernighan and Ken Thompson built the C language together so they could write the new UNIX OS, because Assembly is really fucking difficult to compile.

## What's Linux ?

linux is an operating system created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It's based on minix and it became really popular.

## what's the unix file system

I'll grab a definition from the web : The seven standard Unix file types are regular, directory, symbolic link, FIFO special, block special, character special, and socket as defined by POSIX.
