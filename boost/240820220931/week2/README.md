* **pwd** shows the working directory
* **hostname** shows the computer's host
* **cd** stands for current directory and will do the thing it's named after.
* **cd /** will change dir to root dir.
* **cd ~** change dir to home dir.
* **cd ..** will move you to the parent dir, example /home/livingroom/bathroom/sink | /home/livingroom/bathroom

* **apt update** updates the sources for the packages
* **apt upgrade** updates packages to the latest version
