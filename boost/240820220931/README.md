### Zettelkasten

We've learned how to create a github repo and make a zettelkasten to deploy,dump and put knowledge inside of it. We learned how to identify them
by using a easy format for accessability, readability and being pratical. DON'T use unique identifiers or you're going to have a headache.

* Good to manage my notes
* easy portability
* github files are useful to organize them
* have pen and paper to make a zettelkasten available everywhere you go

### Markdown

Markdown became really useful to me, Rob talked about how it can be used to create documents, maybe pages and even for coding(don't use HTML inside of it, it's a bad idea).
we've made a few zettelkasten notes using markdown basic and there's even a more advanced one with logic for latex and everything. Markdown is really fun to use.
We've learned how to make headers, bold and italic text, adding images, links and tables.

* Good for creating docs
* easy to write it
* simple to organize
