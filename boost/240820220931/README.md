### Zettelkasten

We've learned how to create a github repo and make a zettelkasten to deploy,dump and put knowledge inside of it. We learned how to identify them
by using a easy format for accessability, readability and being pratical. DON'T use unique identifiers or you're going to have a headache.

* Good to manage my notes
* easy portability
* github files are useful to organize them
* have pen and paper to make a zettelkasten available everywhere you go

### Markdown

Markdown became really useful to me, Rob talked about how it can be used to create documents, maybe pages and even for coding(don't use HTML inside of it, it's a bad idea).
we've made a few zettelkasten notes using markdown basic and there's even a more advanced one with logic for latex and everything. Markdown is really fun to use.
We've learned how to make headers, bold and italic text, adding images, links and tables.

* Good for creating docs
* easy to write it
* simple to organize

### Virtualbox

We've installed virtualbox so we can virtually simulate a linux environment with Ubuntu server, it's easier than dual booting and we can actually test
things without any risk of erasing hard drive, deleting files and the usual. We used 2gb for the system and another 20gb for the complements(other things we're gonna install), It was a simple installation, since we do not need dual booting, Ubuntu just erases a fake hard drive(a file), install it and boom, done.

### Ubuntu Server

Quite easy to use, it's just a CLI program, no fancy GUI. I find it soothing, I really need to master the command line and I'll surely do it. 

### COMMAND LINE 

* pwd
* ls
* ls -al
*ls -a
* man ls
* shutdown -h now
* shutdown -r 
* init0 (power off)
