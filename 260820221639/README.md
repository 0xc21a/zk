# The Shell is a translator

My simplistic way of addressing this is just a way of not overly complicating things, the shell basically is a interpreter between human and machine, we usually type our
commands using the cli through the terminal ( obs: we don't need terminals for cli, but we do it anyway). the input is read by the  machine and the output is read by us, le humans.

    #cli #shell #translator
