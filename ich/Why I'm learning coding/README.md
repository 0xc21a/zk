# Why I think coding is essential right now 

**1. It's the future**

I cannot even imagine how many things are run by coding, mostly our tvs, laptops, cellphones, Airplanes, cargo ships and so on. You can notice a pattern 
emerging here, coding is the essential thing in the 21st century and it will become mandatory as long we need more coders. Back in 1991 when Tim Bernes-Lee
invented the ("they talk about this here: https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web".) I'm really sure coding will be like a subject in 
school for future kids. 

## What should I learn first 

essentially there's a debate of which coding language is best fit for the "neveau generation", which is odd because to me, HTML5 and probably markdown would be
awesome for developing coding mentality and other skills. I know HTML5 is not a coding language per se, but it has the logic, the way tags work will only work
if you apply a programming logic. I'm not an expert, I'm just a beginner and that's my personal opinion, I could be dead wrong. I would probably start with
*go programming language*. 

**GO syntax below :**

```GO

fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
fmt.Println("I am in Go Programming World!")
```

    #GOlang #post #coding
