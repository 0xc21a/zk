# Markdown and why 

previously before taking skilstak boost 2022 by Rob, I had no idea markdown existed, that's really unfortunate, because I would use it the shit out of it.
it's so easy to edit text, make some modifications, the "# thing for making the header is wonderful and simple". I haven't tested it on a actual website, although 
I could create a page just using pandoc markdown version. Rob taught us there's thousand of versions created by different folks due to markdown lack of 
standardization.
