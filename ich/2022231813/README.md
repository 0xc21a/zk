# Tmux and Lynx

I'm a curious guy and I couldn't resist the urge to download TMUX and Lynx at the same time, although I know my knowledge related to both of them is still low
I tried using lynx and I'm somewhat satisfied with it. Tmux on the other hand is kinda difficult to get used to, but I'll eventually. Tmux sells itself as a
multiplexer or have as many windows working at the same as you want. I tried searching with lynx and the results are good, I find it fascinating.
