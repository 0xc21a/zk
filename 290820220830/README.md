# I finally connected my windows terminal to my ubuntu machine

I only had to do something quite simple, change from NAT(network address translation) to bridged adapter( my home network) so my computer would recognize my 
ubuntu server as a real "machine". I'm really glad it worked, I should've watched the first half of week 003 from rob's boost sooner.
