# My autodidact path

Rob made me realize I must enforce this path onto me, I was already an autodidact, my english learning was totally self-taught, but I was not organized, I didn't create
tools or made it possible for a readable format, that's why I'm stuck with other languages, I didn't invent a method, which is something I learned about it in the boost.
I will surely apply these coding logics and philosophies to my life.
