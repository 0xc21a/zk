# I've learned how to automate tasks

recently I've dealing with new commands, especially related to virtualbox( headless start through the terminal), so I found a method by simply using the bash script(echo)
to print my output and execute it. I've created a script directory, made a simple file with vi and used the shebang with /bin/bash, now I can automate my machine booting, ssh connection and even turning it off safely.
I'm still learning the commands, but this by far had me blown away,I'm fascinated by automation.
