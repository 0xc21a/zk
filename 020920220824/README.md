# Cloud

I've been thinking about creating a cloud server so I can ssh into the cloud just like in this virtualbox ubuntu server( which mimmicks the cloud), but I haven't got
the chance due to( MONEY), but I will eventually. I find it wonderful to be able to do it + it gathers experience in deploying servers in the cloud.
