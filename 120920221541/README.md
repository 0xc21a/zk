# Learning about find command

I'm using the find command to list . files and other sorts of search mechanisms, Rob doesn't like whereis or locate, so I'll be using find, which is quite useful.
I'll trying to list only files/directories with dot, later I'll searching 10mb files and son. It's a nice tool for coders, hackers and ops engineers. The command
itself is `find . -type f -name '.*'` and it's great.
