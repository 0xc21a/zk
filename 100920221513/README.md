# I learned about binary

It's quite simple, our system is base 10, which multiplies each sequential number by 10, so if we have 10001, we would say, 1(64),0(32),0(16),0(8),1(4), which is the base 2.
1x64=64, 0x32=0,0x16=0, 0x8=0, 1x4=4, so we get 68 as a binary result. there's also decimal and hexadecimal, therefore there's a lot of ways to calculate an specific 
byte. A byte is 8 bits, a kbyte is 1000 to the original value.
