# Ditching vmware for virtualbox

I'm doing this purely for the sake of keep going, because I don't have time to deal with vmware networking problems and dhcp connections and ip addresses, so  I'll be
using the easier solution(  tried fixing vmware for three straight days) and keep learning about shell natives, k8s,docker, go language and all of it from skilstak.
