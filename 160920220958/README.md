# Grep and Regex

Rob taught us about the use of grep, a unix filter and awesome to search for regular expressions(string characters) in files, directories,etc. I'll be studying
regex more deeply, so I can say for certain I know a little(?), well I find grep really useful and thank you Ken Thompson for building using g/re../p.
