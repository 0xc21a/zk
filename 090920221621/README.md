# Finished boost week 4

I've finished boost week 4 and it has been really tiresome, so I maybe rewatch it with more care and I'll pay attention to the commands and probably will create a new
machine brand-new so I can make groups and users. what I learned today was all about chown, chmod, permissions, the file system, how to copy it, move it and maybe
change ownership, also rob taught us how to use scp to copy a file from a remote host to the main host. I think this was the best one so far due to the amount of
content he delivered to us, so I'll keep on watching it again and again until I get it, but I'll move on to boost week 5 by monday, so I'll keep on track.
