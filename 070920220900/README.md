# Permissions and linux files

Rob's been talking about permissions a lot in this boost, week 4 has been quite long, but I'll get used to it, I'll study more after this, research and understand
the permissions, especially after finally being able to create users, I need to put them in a group, and maybe change chmod values or chown ownership.
