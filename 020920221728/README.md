# File permissions

So there's three type of unix permissions, rwx --wx --x(example), which r stand for read and you can figure it out the rest. I'm learning how to chmod the permissions, in this
case allowing my other user(adduser) see and maybe delete a file. It's a test for permissions, especially for those interested in hacking, pentesting and playing CTF.
