# ASK QUESTIONS 

It's extremely important to be active and ask questions, don't backseat or be silent, just ask the shit out of questions, because you must, it's only natural to be
curious, it's the socratic method as well. ACT like a complete imbecile and ask the bare minimum so you will retain the important stuff. Those who are interested enough to
bother the mentor will go places beyond our human comprehension.
