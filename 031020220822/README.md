# Election day 2nd of october, 2022

I was kinda in a hurry to vote early, so I did and it was basically what I was expecting, a huge polarization from both sides. I hate this and I hate these simplifications, because
it's not the reality for the majority, some people won't have suffered what you did, so they have a different perspective of what you believe, so DEAL WITH IT!
