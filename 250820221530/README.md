# I'm back on Windows 10

Rob is teaching us about the windows terminal, we'll probably SSH into the ubuntu server as he uses both windows and ubuntu at the same time due to "virtualboxing". 
that's really good, we'll be pretending there's a cloud where in reality it's a local server.

    #ssh #ubuntu #windows10
