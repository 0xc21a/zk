# The boost so far

It has really been a wonderful experience being part of this skilstak boost 2022, I've learned so much in four days than I would've doing some shitty bootcamp, especially
related to udemy. Rob's way of teaching is out of this earth, he gives us an idea, he plays with it and let us do our homework and go forward with our studies. I would never
understand SSH, or unix systems, file system, inodes, why neovim is worthless, don't use WSL2, gplv3 sucks and so on. I also learned about the existence of markdown, which is
the tool I'm using right now to write this + I would've not had the idea of using zettelkasten without him, so for that, I'm forever in debt with rob and the skilstak initiative.
Basically I cannot describe how much I've learned in just a few days.
