# Vi and vim are superior to nano

I'm sort of a newbie when it comes to file editors, but with my little experience,I've to realize vim/vi are way better than the complicated devil stuff called nano.
Nano just isn't quite the thing for me with all the control bullshit, it sucks to have that as a standard file editor, so I'm sticking with vim and vi for the rest of the
boost and probably forever, it depends wether it will change in the near future.
