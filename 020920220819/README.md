# The linux commands

I've memorized a few, but it takes practice to completely understand what it's going on, like the russian proverb : Повторе́ние -- мать уче́нья( repetition is the mother
of learning). My favorite shortcuts are ctrl+x and z, because of easy access(closer to my hand). I had no idea ctrl+s would freeze my screen in the first time, but I learned it
by myself out of necessity( i froze it accidentally).
