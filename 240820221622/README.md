# Ubuntu Server

I'm installing Ubuntu server in my *virtualbox*, it's easier than the desktop mode and it will be less bloated, I'll required 2gb min, no extra software.
I'll probably test other softwares on my virtualbox, because I'm not inclined to blow up my hard drive dual booting(yet). some folks in the skilstak
had some problems with the BIOS, which is a small OS inside the chip, it's like a firmware( any software who's in a chip). Rob advised to turn on 
hypervisor on the bootloading, which I've done in the past when i was using virtualbox for the first time.
